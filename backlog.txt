[ ] ChatGPT retries

[ ] FlexibleDate refactor
[ ] delete budget
[ ] allow nested budgets like budget for month, week, day separately but interconnected
[ ] consistent config pattern
[ ] add operation input validations
[ ] use ChatGPT as a guidance to improve the interface and operations
[ ] use VCR for HTTP requests in tests
[ ] date edge cases
[ ] 'ago' support
[ ] undo operation
[ ] improve named deictic logic — currently returns next occurance of date. eg next october, next wednesday
[ ] status and get budget are both relying on discerning active budget. iffy.
