[x] current month status
[x] allow single decimal point number
[x] include today's budget left in status
[x] fix weird rounding error — "Spent 4.60 grocies" yielded "Spent €4.59 on groceries"
[x] improve status text using ChatGPT's guidance
[x] create datetime helper
[x] daily spending totals / summary
[x] timezones
[x] use period_ranges
[x] user money gem and use it for currency formatting
[x] fix display bug with timezone stuff
[x] enable `set currency` operation
[x] create rails helper to generate operation
[x] get currency / timezone
[x] refactor to use LedgerEntry instead of Spending
[x] enable registering reimbusements
[x] rethink error handling
[x] refactor into engines (classic vs ai)
[x] new architecture
[x] create date parser

[o] create GPT layer
[o] ensure tests are using DateTime.current with hour and minutes

NEXT STEP: make the new parser be used by the engines.

[ ] use VCR for HTTP requests in tests
[ ] date edge cases
[ ] make operations accept Period objects
[ ] 'ago' support

[ ] improve named deictic logic — currently returns next occurance of date. eg next october, next wednesday
[ ] status and get budget are both relying on discerning active budget. iffy.
